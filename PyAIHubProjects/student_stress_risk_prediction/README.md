# 🎓 Student Stress Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts **student stress risk levels** using machine learning techniques based on academic, psychological, and lifestyle factors.  
The goal is to identify stress patterns early and build an **interpretable ML model** for awareness and prevention.

## 📌 Project Overview

Student stress has become a major concern due to academic pressure, lifestyle imbalance, and mental health challenges.  
This project uses a **Kaggle dataset** and a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict stress risk levels and highlight the most influential factors.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle – *Student Stress Factors: A Comprehensive Analysis*
- **Target Variable:** `stress_level`
- **Features include:**
  - Academic workload
  - Sleep quality
  - Psychological factors
  - Lifestyle and environmental indicators

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

1. Dataset loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Encoding categorical variables  
4. Feature–target separation  
5. Train–test split  
6. Model training using **Random Forest Classifier**  
7. Model evaluation  
8. Feature importance analysis

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  

Evaluation visuals are stored in the `images/` directory.
