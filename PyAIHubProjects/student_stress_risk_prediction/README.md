# Student Stress Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts **student stress risk levels** using machine learning based on academic, psychological, and lifestyle factors.  
The goal is to analyze patterns contributing to stress and build an **explainable ML model** for educational awareness.

## 📌 Project Overview
Student stress is a growing concern due to academic pressure, poor sleep habits, and lifestyle imbalance.  
This project uses a **Kaggle dataset** and a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict stress levels and identify key contributing factors.
