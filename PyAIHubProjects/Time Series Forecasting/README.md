## 📌 Project Overview

Understanding booking trends is critical for hotels to manage capacity, pricing, and staffing.  
In this project, I performed **time series analysis** on a real-world Kaggle dataset to:

- Analyze daily hotel booking trends
- Visualize demand fluctuations over time
- Forecast future booking demand using a rolling window approach

The project emphasizes **clarity, visualization, and business relevance** rather than complex modeling.
