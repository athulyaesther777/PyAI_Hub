# 🧠 Goal-Based AI Agent (Python)

This project demonstrates a **goal-based AI agent** built with Python.  
It showcases how autonomous decision-making systems work using **state, utility scoring, actions, and planning logic**. This is a fundamental concept behind game AI, robotics, and modern intelligent agent systems.

## 🧩 What This Project Is

An AI agent that:
✅ Tracks its internal state (hunger, energy, food)  
✅ Defines **goals** with utility functions  
✅ Chooses actions by simulating their outcomes  
✅ Picks the most optimal action based on utility

This project is part of **Python AI learning** under the **PyAI Hub collection**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🛠️ How It Works

The agent repeatedly goes through these steps:

1. **Perceive current state**  
2. **Simulate all possible actions**  
3. **Score outcomes using utility functions**  
4. **Choose the best action**  
5. **Apply the action to the state**  

This is the same pattern used in real autonomous agents, planning systems, and even some reinforcement learning applications.
