Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis
Objective
Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) on a domain-specific product review dataset to classify sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Implementation Summary
Dataset: Used a custom dataset of product reviews (e.g., electronics domain).
Preprocessing: Included tokenization, label encoding, and splitting into training and validation sets.
Model: Fine-tuned BERT using Hugging Face Transformers in Google Colab.
Optimization: Tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
Evaluation
Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
Addressed common challenges such as overfitting and class imbalance.
Optional: Tested DistilBERT for performance vs. efficiency tradeoff.
